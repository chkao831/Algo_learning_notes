## Binary Search
  - Intuition: When asked for O(logn) time complexity, think about Binary Search
  - Strategy [破刀式]: When asked for something better than O(n), it usually points to O(logn), Binary Search
  
  ```
  start <= end
  mid = (start+end)//2
  ```
  - Problem Type
    - 在排序的數組上進行二分 （OO.....OXXXX..., find X) 
      - 建立OOXX模型：
        - 將左半邊有序數組看作O，右邊看作X
